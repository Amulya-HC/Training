My experience with VIS

The first day on 5th August at 9am, when i logged in and saw vis in the meet i was 
really surprised and worried with few questions on my mind, "He seems like a senior person with lot of knowledge, 
how do we manage with him?".
We started with introduction i wasn't more comfortable to speak or turn on camera but with a heavy heart i just introduced my 
self and as the days were passing we found vis was very comfortable to us, he was open minded, friendly, the activities,  and the inputs he gave us really helped to boost our confidence to speak to everyone effectively irrespective of seniority or knowledge.
From the second of his training itself we were able to comfortably share our thoughts and participate in the activities vis 
was giving us like making paper boomerang, Alphabets activity, story telling, sharing our thoughts on different situtions etc.

All the activities Vis made us to do were very interesting and brain teasing, they seemd simple but they weren't actually, 
when we attempted them, but in one sentense i can say vis classes were "leaning with enjoyment".
Not even a single hour of his classes were felt boring to us, The stories Vis used to tell us were a real world examples and 
his own experiences and this was my favourite part of the training. He really gave a good foundation for all of us which 
is helping us in our next trainings.
And the last day on 12th August it was very difficult to believe that it was the last day of training by vis. Hope to have more 
and more sessions with u Vis.
Thank you for the wonerfull training of 6 days.
